Backtest Signal Log - The "Battle Plan"
==============================================================================
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. This file is your "shopping list" for the data_harvester.py script.
2. Add one historical signal per line.
3. The harvester will read each line, parse the signal, find the exact option
contract, and download its historical price data into a .csv file.
FORMAT:
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS | The exact signal text as it appeared in Discord
NOTES:
- The timestamp is CRITICAL. It tells the backtester exactly when the signal "happened."
- The pipe symbol "|" is the separator.
- Lines starting with "#" are comments and will be ignored.
- The signal text can be in almost any format; our battle-hardened parser
is smart enough to find the ticker, strike, type, and expiry.
