# üöÄ AUTOMATED BACKTESTING PIPELINE - COMPLETE GUIDE

## üìã OVERVIEW

This automation pipeline handles ALL the heavy lifting after you provide signals:
1. **Downloads historical options data** from IBKR
2. **Tests thousands of parameter combinations** automatically
3. **Finds the optimal configuration** for each channel
4. **Generates detailed reports** with recommendations
5. **Creates ready-to-use config templates**

---

## üóÇÔ∏è SETUP (One-Time)

### Step 1: Prepare Folder Structure
```bash
# Run the setup script
bash setup_backtesting.sh

# This creates:
# backtester/channel_signals/     - Your signal files go here
# backtester/optimization_results/ - Results stored here
# backtester/historical_data/      - Downloaded data cached here
```

### Step 2: Add Your Signals
Create one file per Discord channel in `backtester/channel_signals/`:

```
channel_01_signals.txt  - "Options Flow Alpha" channel
channel_02_signals.txt  - "SPX 0DTE Alerts" channel
channel_03_signals.txt  - "Unusual Activity" channel
... up to channel_20_signals.txt
```

**Signal Format (one per line):**
```
SPY 10/15 500C
QQQ 10/15 450P
TSLA 10/16 1000C
NVDA 0DTE 750C
```

## ‚ö° QUICK START - TEST ONE CHANNEL

### Basic Test (16 combinations, ~5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Copy signals to working file
cp backtester/channel_signals/channel_01_signals.txt backtester/signals_to_test.txt

# 2. Download historical data (needs IBKR connection)
python backtester/data_harvester.py

# 3. Run optimization
python parameter_optimizer.py --quick

# 4. View results
cat backtester/optimization_results/*/optimization_summary.txt
```

### Full Test (3,456 combinations, ~2 hours)
```bash
python parameter_optimizer.py  # No --quick flag
```

---

## üî• FULL AUTOMATION - ALL 20 CHANNELS

### Quick Mode (2 hours total)
```bash
python optimize_all_channels.py --quick
```
- Tests 16 parameter combinations per channel
- Total: 320 backtests
- Time: ~6 minutes per channel

### Full Mode (40 hours total - run overnight/weekend)
```bash
python optimize_all_channels.py
```
- Tests 3,456 parameter combinations per channel  
- Total: 69,120 backtests
- Time: ~2 hours per channel

### Test Subset of Channels
```bash
# Test only first 5 channels
python optimize_all_channels.py --quick --channels 5
```

---

## üìä UNDERSTANDING THE OUTPUT

### Per-Channel Results
Each channel gets its own folder:
```
backtester/optimization_results/master_TIMESTAMP/channel_01/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ all_results.csv              # Every test combination
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ optimization_summary.txt     # Top configs + recommendations
```

### Master Report
```
backtester/optimization_results/master_TIMESTAMP/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MASTER_SUMMARY.txt           # Overall rankings + insights
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ master_comparison.csv        # Best config for each channel
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config_template.py           # Ready-to-use config for top channels
```

### Key Metrics Explained

| Metric | Good | Excellent | What It Means |
|--------|------|-----------|---------------|
| **Total P&L** | >$0 | >$5,000 | Total profit/loss |
| **Win Rate** | >50% | >65% | % of profitable trades |
| **Profit Factor** | >1.0 | >1.5 | Win$/Loss$ ratio |
| **Max Drawdown** | <$2,000 | <$1,000 | Largest peak-to-trough loss |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | >1.0 | >2.0 | Risk-adjusted returns |

## üéØ OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Discovery (2 hours)
```bash
python optimize_all_channels.py --quick
```
- Identifies which channels are worth pursuing
- Finds generally good parameters
- Eliminates unprofitable channels

### Phase 2: Deep Optimization (10 hours)
Focus on top 5 channels from Phase 1:
```bash
# For each top channel
cp backtester/channel_signals/channel_03_signals.txt backtester/signals_to_test.txt
python parameter_optimizer.py  # Full mode
```

### Phase 3: Apply Results
1. Open `config_template.py` from master results
2. Copy the configurations to `services/config.py`
3. Add real Discord channel IDs
4. Enable only profitable channels

---

## üîß CUSTOM PARAMETER TESTING

### Create Custom Grid
Edit `param_grid_template.json`:
```json
{
  "breakeven_trigger_percent": [10, 15],
  "trail_method": ["atr"],
  "atr_multiplier": [1.5, 2.0],
  "psar_enabled": [true],
  "rsi_hook_enabled": [false]
}
```

### Run with Custom Parameters
```bash
python parameter_optimizer.py --params param_grid_template.json
```

## üí° PRO TIPS

### 1. **Start Small**
- Test ONE channel first with --quick mode
- Verify the process works before scaling up

### 2. **Prioritize Quality Signals**
- Channels with 50+ signals give more reliable results
- Remove channels with <20 signals

### 3. **Time Management**
- Run quick mode during day (2 hours)
- Run full mode overnight/weekend (40 hours)
- Use a VPS or dedicated machine for long runs

### 4. **Interpret Results Wisely**
- High P&L with huge drawdown = risky
- High win rate with low P&L = poor risk/reward
- Look for Profit Factor >1.5 AND reasonable drawdown

### 5. **Parameter Insights**
The reports tell you which parameters actually matter:
- If "PSAR Enabled" shows similar P&L for True/False, it doesn't matter much
- Focus on parameters with big P&L differences

---

## üö® COMMON ISSUES

### "No signals found"
- Check file format (one signal per line)
- Remove comment lines starting with #
- Ensure correct format: TICKER MM/DD STRIKEC/P

### "Data download failed"
- Ensure IBKR TWS/Gateway is running
- Check connection settings in config.py
- Try manual download first: `python backtester/data_harvester.py`

### "Optimization takes too long"
- Use --quick mode first
- Reduce parameter grid in param_grid_template.json
- Test fewer channels initially

### "Memory error"
- Process fewer channels at once
- Reduce signals per channel (<100)
- Close other applications

## üìà EXAMPLE WORKFLOW

```bash
# Monday: Prepare signals
vim backtester/channel_signals/channel_01_signals.txt
# Add 2 months of signals

# Tuesday: Quick test all channels (2 hours)
python optimize_all_channels.py --quick

# Review results
cat backtester/optimization_results/master_*/MASTER_SUMMARY.txt

# Wednesday-Thursday: Deep optimization on top 5 (overnight)
# Manually test each top performer
python parameter_optimizer.py  # for each top channel

# Friday: Apply to production
# Copy config_template.py settings to services/config.py
# Start paper trading with optimized parameters

# Following Week: Monitor and adjust
```

## üéâ SUCCESS METRICS

You know the automation is working when:
- ‚úÖ Each channel has clear P&L ranking
- ‚úÖ Top channels show Profit Factor >1.5
- ‚úÖ You have specific parameter recommendations
- ‚úÖ Config template is ready to copy/paste
- ‚úÖ You can disable all unprofitable channels

---

## üìù FINAL NOTES

**Remember:**
- Backtesting assumes perfect fills (reality will be worse)
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- Always paper trade new configurations first
- Market conditions change - re-optimize monthly

**The goal:** Find which channels + which parameters = maximum profit with acceptable risk

Ready to automate? Start with:
```bash
bash setup_backtesting.sh
python optimize_all_channels.py --quick --channels 1
```

Good luck! üöÄ
