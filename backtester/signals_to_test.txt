# Backtesting Signal List - "The Flight Plan"
# ==============================================================================
# 
# This file defines which signals to test. It supports TWO formats:
#
# FORMAT 1 (Simple - Recommended for most use cases):
# Just the signal text, one per line. The parser will handle any format.
# Examples:
#   SPY 9/26 500C
#   BTO QQQ 10/3 450P
#   TSLA 0DTE 300C
#   AMD 93P 9/29
#
# FORMAT 2 (Advanced - For precise timestamp simulation):
# YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS | channel_name | signal_text
# Examples:
#   2025-09-26 09:35:00 | test_channel | SPY 9/26 500C
#   2025-10-03 14:22:00 | trader_xyz | BTO QQQ 450P 10/03
#
# NOTES:
# - Lines starting with "#" are comments and will be ignored
# - Empty lines are ignored
# - The data_harvester.py will download historical data for ALL valid signals
# - The backtest_engine.py will simulate trades in chronological order
# - The mock_ib_interface.py (Flight Simulator) will match incoming Discord 
#   signals against these entries and play back the historical data
#
